# CNN-Image-Classification

CNN Image Classification is a web application implemented using HTML, Python and Flask. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.It classifies nature images into 6 categories-buildings, forest, glacier, mountain,sea and street. For better accuracy, VGG16 was used later in order to achieve maximum accuracy. 
 The dataset used for training can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
